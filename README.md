As we wrap up our exciting journey through Python programming, I am pleased to introduce your final project: developing your own Python chatbot! This project is designed to consolidate your learning and provide you with a tangible piece of work that you can showcase to potential employers.

Project Overview:

Your task is to create a functional chatbot using Python. This will involve integrating OpenAI models and familiarizing yourselves with API keys and model pricing. This project will be both challenging and rewarding, providing you with practical experience in software development and artificial intelligence.

Getting Started:

GitHub Classroom: You will find the starter code in our GitHub Classroom. Clone the repository to your local machine to begin your work.

OpenAI Models: Learn how to integrate OpenAI models into your project. You will need to understand how to use API keys securely and manage the costs associated with model usage.

Modify Starter Code: Begin by making modifications to the starter code. Ensure that you understand each part of the code and how it contributes to the functionality of the chatbot.

Project Enhancements:

As your skills and time permit, consider enhancing your chatbot with the following features:

Chat Memory: Implement memory in your chatbot so that it can remember previous parts of the conversation.

Local Server: Utilize a local server like Streamlit to run your chatbot. This will allow for a more interactive experience.

HTML with Streamlit: Enhance the user interface of your chatbot by incorporating HTML elements within Streamlit.

LangChain Framework: Explore the LangChain framework for building chatbots. This can add sophisticated capabilities to your project.

Open Source Model from Hugging Face: As an advanced challenge, integrate an open source model from Hugging Face to create an alternative version of your chatbot.

Encouragement and Conclusion:

This final project is intended to be a fun and educational experience. Do not stress about completing all the enhancements listed. We all have different levels of experience and time constraints, and the primary goal is to learn and end the class on a high note. This project is your opportunity to demonstrate your skills and creativity, so make the most of it!

Remember, you're not just completing a class assignment; you're building a project that could impress future employers. Enjoy the process, learn as much as you can, and feel proud of what you create.

Looking forward to seeing your innovative chatbots!
